# Cost

Parlot estimates what **providers charge you** to run voice and language models—not what you pay Parlot. Your Parlot subscription lives under **Settings → Plan & billing**.

You will see cost in two places:

- **Session Cost** (`/sessions/:sessionId/cost`) — spend for one conversation
- **Cost & margin** (`/cost`) under Observe — your workspace rate card and recent margin

## What goes into cost

Estimates usually combine:

- Large language model (LLM) token usage
- Speech-to-text (STT) and text-to-speech (TTS) usage when your agent reports them
- For phone calls, an estimate of telephony (SIP) minutes from call duration

Figures only appear when Parlot can match usage to a rate. If a model has no rate, cost and margin can look too low until you update the rate card.

## Cost & margin

Open **Observe → Cost & margin**.

| Tab | Use it to |
|-----|-----------|
| **Margin & cost** | Set what you charge clients per minute, then compare revenue to estimated provider cost by agent or client (past 7 days). |
| **Rate card** | See which models appear in usage, what rate applies, and fix unpriced rows. |

The Cost & margin nav item can show a badge with how many models still need a rate. Cost views (Overview, Agents, Sessions) also warn when usage is unpriced.

## Provider list vs your contract

Each rate-card row has a source:

| Badge | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| **List** | Public provider list price from Parlot’s community catalog. Useful as a default when you have not entered a contract rate. |
| **Your contract** | A rate you entered for your organization. This wins over the list price for new sessions from the moment you save it. |
| **Unpriced** | Usage was seen, but Parlot has no list match and you have not set a rate. Cost for that usage is missing until you price it. |

List rates come from the open [voice-prices](https://github.com/mahimailabs/voice-prices) community catalog (vendored into Parlot). Parlot does not mark up those rates—they are pass-through estimates of what providers charge.

Past sessions keep the rate that applied when they ran. Editing a rate changes cost for **new** sessions only; it does not rewrite history.

## Pins vs contract rates

When you **Add model** (or start from a typical voice stack) without changing the suggested list price, Parlot **pins** that model on the rate card so it stays visible. The displayed rate still follows the community catalog when the catalog updates.

When you enter or change **your** dollar rate, Parlot stores a **contract rate** (override). That custom rate is what feeds cost until you reset it to list or remove it.

In short:

- **Pin** — keep the model on the card; keep following list price
- **Your contract** — use the rate you typed for your org

## Needs pricing (unpriced models)

Rows appear automatically from recent session usage. If Parlot cannot match a model to the catalog and you have not set a contract rate, the row is **Unpriced**.

Unpriced usage is excluded from cost, so margin can look better than it really is. Use **Price now** (or open the Rate card tab) to set a rate. Multi-unit models (for example TTS characters and audio duration) can show more than one billable unit—price the unit your invoice uses; unused units can stay unpriced without double-counting.

## Telephony estimates

For sessions on the phone channel, Parlot can estimate telephony cost from **call duration**, not from a model usage metric. That estimate uses a telephony rate from your rate card or the community catalog when available. Treat it as an estimate for pass-through cost visibility, not a carrier invoice.

## Margin

On the **Margin & cost** tab:

1. Set **You charge per minute** (one organization-wide sell price).
2. Parlot multiplies that price by session minutes to estimate revenue.
3. Margin compares that revenue to estimated provider cost for the past 7 days, grouped by agent or client.

If sell price is empty, revenue and margin stay blank. If models are unpriced, cost can be understated—watch for warnings and incomplete-cost icons on rows that show near-zero cost despite real traffic.

Export CSV when you need a snapshot for finance review. Exports may warn when sell price is missing or models are still unpriced.

## Session Cost tab

Use the session **Cost** tab when you need the bill of materials for one interaction (stage totals and usage). Use Overview and agent Cost tabs for fleet trends. Use **Cost & margin** when rates or margin look wrong.
